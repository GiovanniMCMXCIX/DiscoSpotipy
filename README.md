# DiscoSpotipy
Spotify Rich Presence for Discord written in Python.

## Quick Notes
• If you get redirected to a "This site can’t be reached" page just copy and paste the url into the console.
• You might ask `Why is my status named "music on spotify" instead of just "Spotify"?`, because Discord is screwing with the presence and won't show for everyone else if the name is "Spotify".

## Requirements
• Python 3.6+
• `aiohttp` and `spotipy` libraries
• `psutil` for windows users
